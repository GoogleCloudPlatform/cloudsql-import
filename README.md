# Cloud SQL import tool

**WARNING**: _this project has been deprecated and is no longer supported or maintained._ 

_This project will be archived on April 1, 2020._

`cloudsql-import` is a program resilient to restarts that replays a
mysql dump to a MySQL server. The resilience is gained by saving the
current state after each query. The final goal is for the program to
also speed up the replay by issuing some queries in parallel.

## How to build the tool

You can install the package in your [$GOPATH](http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GOPATH "GOPATH") with the [go tool](http://golang.org/cmd/go/ "go command") using the following command:

```
go get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-import
```

Note that this requires [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your
machine and in your system's `PATH`.

The tool binary should be at `$GOPATH/bin/cloudsql-import`.

## How to run the tool

```
cloudsql-import --dump=dump.sql --dsn='USER:ROOT@tcp(X.X.X.X:3306)/YYYY'
```

Where `YYYY` is a (optional) database name.
